//
// This function creates a feature vector for each chunk found in document.
// A feature vector contains a numerical representation of the chunk's
// properties like HTML element type, parent element type, number of words,
// number of sentences and stuff like this.
//
// A logistic regression model is used to calculate scores based on these
// feature vectors. Then, in some kind of meta / ensemble learning approach,
// a second type of feature vector is created based on these scores.
// This feature vector is fed to our random forest and finally
// the random forest's predictions are used to generate the result.
//
// By now you might have noticed that I'm exceptionally bad at naming and
// describing things properly.
