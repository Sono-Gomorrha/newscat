### Overview

newscat is a news content / article extractor written in just 1000
lines of Go code. It tries to deliver the news article content while
excluding clutter like image and video captions, editorial side notes,
"related content" article teasers, advertisements, user comments and meta
data.

### Training and Evaluation

300 news articles were gathered by crawling top submissions from
various news-related Reddit communities.
A golden standard was created for every HTML page by manually adding a custom
HTML5 data attribute to the elements containing relevant content.

The data set was split into training and test data.
50 randomly chosen news articles were used to train newscat. The remaining
250 news articles were used to evaluate the rate the content
extraction quality.
For each news article, we compared the element-level predictions
with the real labels and calculated precision, recall and the balanced F-score.

The above figure shows the resulting F-scores ordered in increasing magnitude.
The x-axis shows the percentage of articles whose F-scores fall below the
value indicated by the y-axis. In other words: the percentiles.
